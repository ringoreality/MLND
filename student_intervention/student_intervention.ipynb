    "\n",
    "1. GaussianNB\n",
    "    - Application: It could be used for text categorization, for example spam email detection, where we are given bags of words as features and try to predict if it's a spam.\n",
    "    - Pros: It is rather efficient and have worked well in real applications. It works well when the assumption of conditional indepence is met among the features.\n",
    "    - Cons: NB makes the assumption that given the class label, the features are independent of each other, which might not be the case for certain problems. Also comparisons have shown that NB may be outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests.\n",
    "    - Reason: After a first look of the problem, it seems very similar to a spam detection problem, with an implicit assumption that \"just like the word 'deal' points to a spam, a high absence number points to a school dropout\". In video lectures I've learnt that NB performs well on spam detection in real world applications and thought of it as a first choice.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. KNeighbors\n",
    "    - Application: kNN is a very versatile and could be used in many different classification and regression problems. For example, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213001332\">this paper</a> showed an application using kNN in neuraological studies to segment matter lesion.\n",
    "    - Pros: It's a versatile and \"simple\" method. Being a non-parametric instance-based learning algorithm, kNN performs well when there's well-defined local structures in the data.\n",
    "    - Cons: It may \"overbelieve\" local data, and may perform badly on very skewed data. For example in binary classification, if the two classes are very \"muddily\" mixed together, kNN may result in wierd looking decision boundaries.\n",
    "    - Reason: An intuition is that maybe passed students are similar, and dropouts are alike. Implicitly, that's saying the local strutures in the feature space may be interesting to look at. Since kNN is a powerful yet simple tool to adapt locally, this became my second choice.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. SVM\n",
    "    - Application: SVM is a popular and powerful algorithm in both classification and regression problems. <a href=\"Support vector machine\">The wikipedia page</a> mentioned applications such as text categorization and hand-written digits recognition.\n",
    "    - Pros: Known as a \"large margin\" classifier, SVM tends to seperate the feature space (or a higher dimension projected space) with the largest margin. With kernel tricks, SVM is very useful in applications where a \"good\" decision boundary is desired. SVM performs well when there exist a \"good\" decision boundary, i.e. with structures that's easily seperable.\n",
    "    - Cons: SVM tries to seperate the space with a large margin. Thus if the data points are very sticky and are mixed up together (take white noise for an example), SVM may not perform as well. Also, in kernel tricks, SVM tries to seperate in some higher dimensional space, this may be computationally costly (personal opinion).\n",
    "    - Reason: A student intervention system should only output negative results when it's quite confident that the student is not doing well. Otherwise it may be bad for day-to-day school management and students' psychological health. Therefore we desire a classifier that gives reasonable decision boundaries. Since SVM has the property to fit to the \"largest margin\", this is my third choice."

    "**Experiment Results**\n",
    "- Training Time: GaussianNB has an intermediate training time, in the order of 0.001s, growing rather slowly with the size of training set. KNN has slightly shorter training time than GaussianNB, also not clearly dependent on the size of training set. SVM has the longest training time, growing rather fast with the size of training test. \n",
    "- Prediction Time (test): Both GaussianNB and SVM gives predictions on the test set relatively fast, in the order of 0.001s. Since KNN is a instance-based learning algorithm, the prediction time is longer than the other two models.\n",
    "- F1 score (train): GaussianNb gives intermediate F1 score on the training set. But as the size of training set grows, the F1 score goes down, which might indicate that the model is suffering from high bias, not even fitting well to the training data. KNN gives relatively good F1 score, especially with more training examples. SVM does very well in terms of F1 score, performing consistently good.\n",
    "- F1 score (test): In the first 6 rows in the tables, neither GaussianNb nor KNN gave a F1 score higher than 0.7500, considering that their performances on test set are better, this may suggest that both models are not generalizing well to the test set. On the other hand, SVM gives comparatively better results on the test set, exceeding 0.7500 in three runs. Although it's decreasing with the growth of training set size, still it outperforms the other two models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Considerations**\n",
    "- Data: In a supervised learning setup, our original dataset only has 395 examples, personally I think that's a very small amount of data. Thus, an algorithm that overfits the data may be very bad in real application.\n",
    "- Resources and Cost: All 3 of the models run quite fast. In a system where we need to monitor and maybe intervene a student's academic life, a time that's in the order of 0.001s is neglectable. Also, it makes sense to put more penalties on prediction time than training time, since we want to engage as soon as a student shows enough evidence to possibly drop out, and potentially influence his future. On the other hand, a longer system setup with fast predictions doesn't seem so bad.\n",
    "- Performance: This is the number 1 consideration we should have. Compared with a slower but accurate system, a fast but inaacurate system maybe disastrous for the student and the family (No parents want to hear that their kid is going to drop out, right?). An accurate prediction is what makes this system make sense in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, although SVM takes longer to train, it makes predictions rather fast, and most importantly, tends to give the best predictions on the test set. Thus, it is my choice for the model."

A good model should not only try to differentiate graduates and dropouts with great confidence, but also consider all factors at the same time.\n",

    "Compared with the untuned model, which had 0.8591, 0.8693, 0.8692 for training, 0.7838, 0.7755, 0.7586 for testing, with training size equal to 100, 200 and 300 respectively, the final F1 score is slightly lower on the training set, but better on the test set.\n",

    "I consider the tuning to have worked, because essentially what we care about is whether or not the model can generalize well on the test set, and since the final model outperforms the default ones on the test set, this is a good result.\n",

    "One sidenote I should make is that, I only tuned C and gamma parameters for SVM with a rbf kernel. Using grid search or some other searching algorithms in the parameter space including different kernels, may give better results."
