Software:
Python 2.7.12
numpy 1.11.1
tensorflow 1.0.0
keras 2.0.2

Files:
img/        final test results for Q and QNN model, neural network output screenshots
Cube.py     cube class that implements a pocket cube
Q.py        script that trains and tests on the Q-Learning agent
Q.pickle    Q agent Train-Test history information and trained Q-Table
QNN.py      script that trains and tests on the QNN agent
QNNmodel    trained QNN agent's keras neural network model
QNN.pickle  QNN agent Train-Test history information
Cube.ipynb  iPython Notebook that does tests and visualization
Cube.html   exported html file the Cube.ipynb
report.odt  libreoffice file of the project report
report.pdf  final pdf export from report.odt
README      you are reading it

Instructions:
1.  Q.py and QNN.py are used for training and testing
    the results are stored in Q.pickle and QNN.pickle
    since running the original scripts take several hours each
    it's recommended to load the trained Q-Table and trained keras neural network with Cube.ipynb
2.  in QNN.py there's a piece of code that's commented out
    which implements real-time monitoring of the neural networks output during training
    if you are interested to see the convergence (or non-convergence) of the network
    feel free to uncommet it (remember to comment out the print statements in the Train-Test codes)
